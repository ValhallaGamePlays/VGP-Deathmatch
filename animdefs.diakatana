So I'm pretty sure there's a bunch of duplicates I didn't delete because there seem to be multiple copies of
everything, but one or two pixels are different so that, you know, a duplicate finding program is useless. More
or less, I've tried to pick out all I can, but there are no promises. I probably missed some animations, and
there might be some model skins in here, but I did try to do everything I could.

It's too bad this game was a flop, because these textures are quite neat. They're in Doom-friendly sizes and
a lot of them fit the Doom/Quake theme pretty well so I hope you enjoy them. These were a bitch to get.

I didn't include the skyboxes because those alone, unpacked, are like 32 MB. I'll probably convert them to
JPEG (put away the rapesticks, high-quality JPEGs, you can't tell the difference) and upload them to my
MediaFire by themselves like I did with Daggerfall's skies. Some of them are pretty neat so PM me on R667 if you
want them.

Oh also first new pack since I got b7 from ZDoom so fuck those guys. --Ceeb

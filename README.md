VGPDM is a community mapping project for Doom 2 Deathmatch. In its completion,
it will harbor 20 custom maps created by various members of the Valhalla Game Plays 
community. In order to work out of this project, you must use GZDoom Builder and 
create your map in UDMF format. Set your first resource as skulltag_content-3.0-beta01.pk3
and your second as the master directory of this git. If you are using Windows, make sure
your git master directory is not set to read-only as this may make sharing resources
problematic. If you would like to work along with us, please message me a request for 
team invite.
